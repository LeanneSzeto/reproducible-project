##Project name: 

##Chicago-Bulls-Project


##Description:

##The aim of this project is to carry out reproducible data analysis based on 2018-2019 team and players performance statistics in order to select five players for the Chicago Bull for the next NBA season. With a team budget of $118 million, playerâ€™s salaries are also taken into account. Multiple linear regression is applied to develop the winning percentage model for the project, as to justify which player has the specific strength in related to the winning percentage.
